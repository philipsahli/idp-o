# innominatus Documentation

Welcome to **innominatus** - a Score-based platform orchestration component designed for integration into enterprise Internal Developer Platform (IDP) ecosystems.

## What is innominatus?

innominatus provides centralized execution of multi-step workflows from Score specifications with database persistence and RESTful API integration. It acts as the orchestration layer in your IDP, handling everything from infrastructure provisioning to application deployment.

## Key Features

- **Score-Based**: Native support for Score specifications
- **Multi-Step Workflows**: Orchestrate complex deployments with Terraform, Kubernetes, Ansible
- **Golden Paths**: Pre-defined workflows for common platform patterns
- **Variable Context**: Share data between workflow steps with powerful interpolation
- **Conditional Execution**: Dynamic workflows that adapt based on results
- **Parallel Execution**: Run independent steps concurrently for faster deployments
- **API-First**: RESTful API for platform integration
- **Database Persistence**: Track workflow execution history and audit trails

## Quick Start

```bash
# Start the server
./innominatus

# Deploy an application
./innominatus-ctl run deploy-app score-spec.yaml

# Check status
./innominatus-ctl status my-app
```

## Use Cases

### Platform Integration
Integrate with existing IDPs like Backstage, CNOE, or custom platforms via REST API.

### Golden Path Deployment
Use pre-defined workflows for standardized application deployment patterns.

### Multi-Environment Management
Deploy applications across development, staging, and production with environment-specific configuration.

### GitOps Orchestration
Trigger workflows from Git repositories and integrate with ArgoCD.
